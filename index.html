                Oh Crap! I've fallen behind. Life just caught up real quick and suddenly I'm behind on my own blog posts and portfolio. I'm spent more time talking about making games than working on my own, and now it's piling up. What I need is one of them smancy in game assistants that tell me how to life and adult.

                    <p class="content">Like any other day I woke up around 6a, ready to lay in bed till 9a. This isn't a habit I've been proud of, i've just had so much going on in my life it's been a comfortable bit of solace. The thing is, I usually end up feeling bad about or regretting it during the day. It's said the ADHD mind like the pressure of a time crunch, or that anxiety ( I'm sure there's another phrasing ) to get that dopamine feed to pushes you. But I hate relying on that. Honestly, I don't like relying on anything cause that means without it your hobbled. But today, as I get into my comfortable groove of sitting, playing games on my tablet and watching tv, I had an uncomfortable thought... What If I just... didn't?</p>

                    <p class="content">    It's amazing how much time I've invested into a world that has no real tangible gains irl. For as much time as I've spent shooting frost bolts, I can barely throw a snowball. How did World of Warcraft train me to master something in their game, I can barely do in real life? And why do I let them?</p>
