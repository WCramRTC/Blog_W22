            Oh Crap! I've fallen behind. Life just caught up real quick and suddenly I'm behind on my own blog posts and portfolio. I'm spent more time talking about making games than working on my own, and now it's piling up. What I need is one of them smancy in game assistants that tell me how to life and adult.
