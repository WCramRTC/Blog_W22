    <p>Like any other day I woke up around 6a, ready to lay in bed till 9a. This isn't a habit I've been proud of, i've just had so much going on in my life it's been a comfortable bit of solace. The thing is, I usually end up feeling bad about or regretting it during the day. It's said the ADHD mind like the pressure of a time crunch, or that anxity ( I'm sure there's another phrasing ) to get that dopeamin feed to pushes you. But I hate relying on that. Honestly, I don't like relying on anything cause that means without it your hobbled. But today, as I get into my comfortable groove of sitting, playing games on my tablet and watching tv, I had an uncomfortable thought... What If I just... didn't?</p>
    <p>Recently I've been binge watching and rewatching a fantastic youtuber named Beau Miles, The Human Bean guy but really a master of doing. During his videos he treats life as a constant experiement that he can put his mind and body through, and his insightful and honest observations are a joy to watch, and possible a mirror to our own response to the world. I greatly respect how he deconstructs his responses, both good and bad, and views them with a scientific, and whemiscal, eye and response. "Oh eating 100 cans of beans make me a dick, but it also...". Which got me thinking, what if I acknowledge myself in such a manner?</p>
    <p>I know that this is Emotional Intelligence and all, but I've a habit of acknowleding by word and then shrugging off truely diving into something. But watching Beau I realized I want to observe myself and understand, not just sit there blaming "My Bad Day" or everyone else for a rut. So as I sit there, laying in bed I ask, "what if I didn't lay in bed?". And to that my whole body tensed up. The thought of not giving into my habits and taking the easy way was showing resistence and I knew it. But that acknowledgement of knowing, that excited me. That was the scientific part. The hinge that could swing either way. Sit in bed, play on my tablet till the world work up around me. Or get up and get started, let the world catch up to me. Did it work? Well 30 mins awake and I've got my breakfast and tea, I'm about to do a twitch stream with a friend, and I've written this blog. Not bad for being uncomfortable"</p>
